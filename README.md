# Purpose of the Project :

Create a basic power pc assembler emulator that can be used to quick and easy test code online with minimal work.

# User Stories :

1) as a user i want to be able to input code and quickly see the outcome of the code

2) as a user i want to be able to know what commands are so far usable

3) as a visitor i want to be able to learn a little about how low level operations work. 



# Features :

1) Memory Start

    Main way to interact with the page. Input code in hex and any extra data after

2) Registers start

    Allow you to set extra initial conditions of registers of memory

3) emulator start

    When pressed, full emulator side of page is reloaded with initial conditions specified by the user 

4) emulation

    Allows the user to start the interpretter and steps through code as a processor actually would, updating all visuals to show the new state of the machine

5) play/step

    allows user to emulate either one step at a time or in large jumps 

6) limited instruction set 

    this implementation is only going to have a few commands implemented so that it can be finished within a reasonable amount of time. 
    planned command types are all branch commands, compare, add, multiply, subtract and load 

# Future Features: 


1) skip

    allow user to skip a command in testing 

2) edit memory/registers during emulation 

    allow editting the emulator as its running

3) larger instruction set

    once this is done as a small project, i plan to incrementally increase the implemented instruction set so this can be used to write more complicated codes.
